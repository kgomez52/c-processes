The first function we will look at is pipe(). This function creates a pipe that is accessed through the int fd[] file descriptors. fd[0] is the read end of the pipe, and fd[1] is the write end. The next file to look at is write(). This function writes up to the specified number of bytes given in it is parameter. It also writes into the specified buffer given in it is parameters. If the write is successful the number of bytes written it returned. The final function to talk about is close(). This function is used to close a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file and may be reused. If close is successful it will return 0.
