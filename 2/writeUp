The first function we are looking at is shm_open(). shm_open is called by a process to create a shared memory object. The first parameter of shm_open is the name of the shared memory objct. Processes that wish to access the shared memory, must refer to the object by it is name. The second paramter specifies how the shared memory object is being handled. For example a user can say O_CREAT. Which will create the shared memory object if it does not yet exist. The last paramter establishes the file-access permission of the shared memory object.A successful call to shm_open returns an integer file descriptor for the shared memory object. The next function to look at is ftruncate(). Ftruncate is used to configure the size of the shared memory object in bytes. If ftruncate is successful the function will return 0. The next function to discuss is mmap(). mmap establishes a memory mapped file containing the shared memory object. It returns a pointer to the memory mapped file that is used for accessing the shared memory object. The last function to go over is shm_unlink(). This function is invoked by the consumer. The function removes the shared memory segment after the consumer has accessed it. If the function is successful the value zero will be returned.
