The function to go over is fork(). Fork creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process is referred to as the child process and the calling process is the parent process of the child process. If fork is successful, it will return zero to the child process and the process ID of the newly created child to the parent process. If fork is not successful it will return -1 to the parent. Each child process may only have one parent process. The next function is execlp(). exec is a function commonly used after fork. The function replaces the the process is memory space with a new program. exec loads a binary file into memory and starts its execution. In the program typed up execlp() is used. This is a version of exec. lp just stands for long parameter. The last function to discuss is wait(). Wait is issued by the parent process. It causes the parent process to wait for the child process to complete. When the child process completes, the parent process resumes from the call to wait. Where it completes using the exit() system call.
